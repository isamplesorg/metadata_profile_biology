# **Concept scheme:** iSamples Biological Entity Extension: Basic taxon classes for biological entity

Vocabulary last modified:  2023-03-23

subtitle: 
  This is a vocabulary to categorize sampled organisms (whole or part) according to taxonomic classes. Classes are based largely on taxonomy found in Wikipedia, particularly Whittaker's five kingdom system (1969) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_(biology), https://doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.163.3863.150). The intended use is in iSamples cross domain categorization of material samples, recognizing that there are multiple view for taxonaomy and cladistist for the tree of life. This is a high level view intended for cross domain purposes, not expert analysis. Other extension vocablaries should be used for other taxonomic schemes
